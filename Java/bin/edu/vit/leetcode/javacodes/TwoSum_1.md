# Problem Description
### Some statements *may* be unique to the java solution
<b>
Given an array and an integer (say i). You need to return the indices (Plural of index) of those values in the array whose summation equals to the integer i.
<br><br>
You need to return an integer array as output.
</b>

## Problem Assumptions
> ***You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.***
>>*This assumption allows you to fix the array size of 2 (which is expected as output)*

> ***You may not use the same element twice*** 

>***You can return the answer in any order.***

## Sample Inputs/Outputs

***1*** 

*Input*: **Input_Array** = [2,7,11,15], **Target_Integer** = 9

*Output*: [0,1]

***2***

*Input*: **Input_Array** = [3,3], **Target_Integer** = 6

*Output*: [0,1]
